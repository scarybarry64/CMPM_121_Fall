Use WASD to move the cube around.

All objectives, minus the extra credit, are completed.

The first two rooms/cameras don't move, similar to Resident Evil.
The third room/camera follows the player on the y-axis.

The only thing to note is when switching rooms, the camera sometimes
switches to the wrong room. This only happens if you enter the invisible
door trigger and then immediately go back to the previous room (i.e. you
begin in room 1, go into the door trigger, then back into room 1, which
will switch to room 2 camera). To fix this, do the same thing to revert
to the correct camera.
